    "# Broker Selection- Why Not Always Go To The \"Best\" ?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the OTC instruments that are traded over voice, a trader chooses one or two broker from the all available ones to trade with. Someone asked the other day why if we should simply go to the top ranked brokers for every clip. Here I demonstrate why going to our top one or two brokers every time is not the best idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with stating the objective of this exercise- to minimize the total cost of all trades in a day for a given ticker. The demonstration relates to the problem of [N-armed bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit), translated to our language and situation below: \n",
    "\n",
    "*For a given ticker, we have a few clips to execute over the course of the day. For each clip, we have N different brokers to choose from. On choosing any broker, we pay some cost which we assume comes from a stationary pdf. Our objective is to minimize the cost over the day. Now suppose we believe (estimate) that GS has the lowest expected cost and the costs for other brokers are uncertain but close to this value. Which broker should we choose for various clips?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration vs Exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the exploration vs exploitation dilemma. We can exploit our knowledge and choose the broker that we believe (estimate) has the lowest expected cost- call this the “greedy action”. An exploration strategy could be that we choose the greedy action most of the time, but choose a random action in ε fraction of cases. This is called a “ε-greedy” strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical simulation can shed some light. Let's also explicitly state some major assumptions here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Succesive clips are not autocorrelated so you are free to go to the same broker repeatedly without the fear of them skewing away from you.\n",
    "2. Cost for each broker is stationary.\n",
    "3. We have a good way of measuring the realized cost (assumed to be bid-offer plus market impact) of each clip.\n",
    "4. Cost is the only criterion in choosing brokers, implying that the rest of the quality of service is immaterial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The setup and the variables\n",
    "Assume we have 1000 trades to do, and for each trade we have 10 choices of brokers. The true expected cost of trading with any broker is unknown to us. Lets fix the unknown true expected cost at some random values derived from a std normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step (1000 trades) of a given simulation (2000 simulations), we choose a broker and pay/realize a cost = mean cost for the chosen broker + noise. The noise is a standard normal random variable. I have also declared a noise multiplier which can be changed to see the effect of noise on the performance of a given broker selection strategy as discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used vectorization to keep the number of loops in check, but have limited the dimentions of various arrays/dataframes to 2. I hope it makes it easier to keep track of the logic without hampering readability."

    "Greedy strategy doesn’t seem that bad now. It performs better than ε=0.1 although ε=0.05 still performs the best. What is happening is that a low initial cost estimate forces the greedy strategy to explore more than it otherwise would. This leads to it behave similar to a ε-greedy strategy temporarily as it is unable to find a broker with cost lower than the initial estimate. This temporary exploration enables it to estimate the best brokers better.\n",

We have seen that the market impact across brokers tends to be extremely noisy so we should be leaning towards more exploration.\n",
